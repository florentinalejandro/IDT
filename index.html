        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. 
        I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. 
        I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. 
        I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
        The next 12 weeks was the best – and most grueling – time of my life. 
        Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. 
        I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. 
        I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
        The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. 
        The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. 
        It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. 
        In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. 
        It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”

        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.

        “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.
